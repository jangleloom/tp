# Harmony User Guide

Harmony is a **desktop app for managing contacts and their gaming aliases, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Harmony can help you keep track of your friends' gaming identities faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Harmony.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar harmony.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `contact add n/John Doe` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to Harmony.

   * `game add 1 g/Valorant` : Adds the game `Valorant` to the 1st contact shown.

   * `alias add 1 g/Valorant al/JohnnyV` : Adds the alias `JohnnyV` to the 1st contact's `Valorant` game.

   * `contact delete n/John Doe` : Deletes the contact named `John Doe` (with confirmation prompt).

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands follow the format `CATEGORY ACTION`, where `CATEGORY` is `contact`, `game`, or `alias`, followed by an action such as `add`, `delete`, or `edit`.<br>
  e.g. `contact add`, `game delete`, `alias add`.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `contact add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `contact add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `contact add n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `contact add n/John Doe t/friend` or as `contact add n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* For `game` and `alias` commands, a contact can be targeted either by their index in the displayed list (`INDEX`) or by name (`n/CONTACT_NAME`).<br>
  e.g. `game add 1 g/Valorant` and `game add n/John Doe g/Valorant` both add the game to the same contact.

* `INDEX` must be a positive integer and must appear before any prefixed parameters.<br>
  e.g. `game add 1 g/Valorant`, not `game add g/Valorant 1`.

* Prefixed parameters (those using `n/`, `g/`, `al/`, `t/`, etc.) can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. `contact add n/John Doe t/friend` and `contact add t/friend n/John Doe` are both acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

Examples:
* `contact add n/John Doe`

### Editing a contact's name : `contact edit`

Renames an existing contact in Harmony.

Format:
* By index: `contact edit INDEX e/NEW_NAME`
* By name: `contact edit n/NAME e/NEW_NAME`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list. Must be a positive integer.
* Use `0` as the index to edit your own user profile.
* Providing both `INDEX` and `n/NAME` at the same time is not allowed.
* The contact's games and aliases are preserved after the rename.
* `NEW_NAME` must not already belong to another contact.

Examples:

* `contact edit n/Betsy Crowe e/Elizabeth Crowe` Renames `Betsy Crowe` to `Elizabeth Crowe`.

### Locating persons: `find`

Finds persons by name, game, or alias.

**Find by name:**

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* All keywords must be present in the name (i.e. `AND` search).
  e.g. `find Hans Bo` will only return contacts whose name contains both `Hans` and `Bo`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find John Doe` returns `John Doe` but not `John Smith` or `Jane Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex David` but not `Alex Yeoh` or `David Li`

**Find by game:**

Format: `find g/GAME_NAME`

* Returns all persons who have the specified game.
* The search is case-insensitive.

Examples:
* `find g/Valorant` returns all persons who have `Valorant` in their game list.

**Find by alias:**

Format: `find al/ALIAS`

* Returns all persons who have the specified alias (across all games).
* The search is case-insensitive.

Examples:
* `find al/Benjumpin` returns all persons with the alias `Benjumpin`.

**Combined search:**

Format: `find [KEYWORD]…​ [g/GAME_NAME] [al/ALIAS]`

* All specified constraints must be satisfied (i.e. `AND` search).
* At least one constraint must be provided.

Examples:
* `find Alice g/Valorant` returns contacts named `Alice` who have `Valorant` in their game list.
* `find g/Valorant al/Ace` returns contacts who play `Valorant` with the alias `Ace`.
* `find Alice g/Valorant al/Ace` returns contacts named `Alice` who play `Valorant` with the alias `Ace`.

### Deleting a contact : `contact delete`

Deletes the specified contact from Harmony.

Format: `contact delete INDEX` or `contact delete n/NAME`

* Deletes the contact at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed list, or whose name matches `NAME` (case-insensitive).
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3…​). Use `0` to target your own user profile.
* A confirmation prompt will appear. Type `y` or `yes` to confirm, or `n` or `no` to cancel.
* Any other input cancels the deletion.

Examples:
* `contact delete 1` prompts for confirmation, then deletes the 1st contact in the list.
* `contact delete n/John Doe` prompts for confirmation, then deletes the contact named `John Doe`.
* `contact delete n/Betsy` prompts for confirmation, then deletes the contact named `Betsy`.

## Data Management

### Saving the data

Harmony data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Harmony data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Harmony will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause Harmony to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install Harmony on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Harmony home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
